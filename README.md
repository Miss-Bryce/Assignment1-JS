# Express Portfolio for Javascript
Overview: Create your Personal Portfolio Website using ExpressJS and implementing the Handlebars templating engine. Your site must be hosted live on a cloud service such as Heroku (recommended), Microsoft Azure, AWS, or Digital Ocean.

## Instructions:
This Express site must include the pages from your Personal Portfolio 4 pages – your Home page, an About Me page, a Projects page, and a Contact Me page.

1.	Your Portfolio site will use ExpressJS and NodeJS and your web pages have been split to use different View templates and partials by implementing the Handlebars templating engine and Express Routes (4 Marks: GUI, 4 Marks: Functionality):
a.	You need minimum 1 view template (4 Marks: Functionality, 4 Marks: GUI).
b.	An Express Route must exist for each page of your site. Note: You will need to use the app.get(path, callback(req, res, next)) method structure with a res.render(view, locals) method call to render each view (4 Marks: Functionality).
2.	Your site will use the new structure created by the Express Generator. Your site files will be migrated to work within the public, controllers (or routes) and views folders (20 Marks: Site Structure):
a.	Generate your site structure with the Express Generator. Note: You must use the 
--views=hbs option to ensure that you implement the Handlebars templating engine for Express (3 Marks: Site Structure).
b.	Your JavaScript, CSS and Multimedia Asset Files should be moved to separate folders within the public folder. Using the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework or a 3rd party theme (must reference the source) is strongly recommended.  Note: the public folder is part of the path and does not have to be referenced (3 Marks: Site Structure).
c.	You will define routes for all of your pages in the index.js file in your controllers folder (1 Mark: Site Structure).
d.	Your views folder will contain your HBS page templates. Use a layout template to add a shared header and footer to your site. Footer should include links to your GitHub and LinkedIn pages. (6 Marks: Site Structure).
e.	All Your Code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, etc.) is error free (2 Marks: Site Structure).
f.	The latest version of your site will be hosted live and error free on a Cloud Hosting Service (5 Marks: Site Structure).
3.	Share your files on GitHub to demonstrate Version Control Best Practices and push your site to a cloud host (4 Marks: Version Control, 4 Marks: Cloud Hosting).
a.	Your repository must include your code and be well structured (2 Marks: Version Control).
b.	Your repository must be private and you must add me – ifotn – as a collaborator.  Include commits that demonstrate the project being updated at different stages of development – each time a major change is implemented (2 Marks: Version Control).
c.	You must deploy your site to your Cloud Server using git (4 Marks: Cloud Hosting).

Optional Site Features (i.e. Potential Bonus Marks).
A.	Use the Angular or React front-end framework to improve interactivity and to implement the MVC design pattern (4 Bonus Marks).
B.	Create a working contact form that sends the form inputs via email on the Contact Me page using node.js and appropriate node packages (2 Bonus Marks).
C.	Create an external document (MS Word or PDF) that includes page wireframes, an explanation of the technologies used, and a Style Guide that details visual elements such as fonts and colours (2 Bonus Marks).
D.	Attach a full domain name to your site (e.g. http://www.richfreeman.ca).  You get 1 free domain name for 1 year with your GitHub Student Pack account. (1 Bonus Mark).

Your submission should include:
1.	A link to a private GitHub repository – invite me – ifotn – as a collaborator.
